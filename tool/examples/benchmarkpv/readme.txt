Some benchmark taken from my course Program Semantics and Verification.
The benchmark provides several relatively simple programs, but they are
parameterized by an 'experiment-parameter' N (a concrete number) that
Used to force loops in the programs to iterate N times, and hence forcing
The verifier to investigate longer executions to reach the post-condition
assertions.
